# School-Proj
Unity 2D Game

Hello, I'm developing this game for a school project that will determine whether or not I pass the school year. I need help finishing the game because I'm having a lot of difficulty and I don't have much time to finish it.

I would really appreciate all the help possible and for you to comment on the code you created so I could learn and understand it.
